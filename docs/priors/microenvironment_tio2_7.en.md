# Strong (But Not Exhaustive) Prior: 7 Regulation Mechanisms of Dual‑Metal‑Doped TiO₂

Source (Chinese): `original_assets/微环境作用分类.docx`

This is a curated “mechanism checklist” for **M₁M₂‑TiO₂ (dual‑metal doped TiO₂)** in photocatalytic CO₂ reduction / coupling. It is intended to be used as a **strong prior** (the agent should consider each item systematically), but it is **NOT complete**: literature may add additional factors, and real performance is often driven by multiple coupled effects.

## How to Use This Checklist (Agent Behavior)

- Do **not** assume a single mechanism explains everything; multiple mechanisms may act together.
- For each recommendation or analysis, consider how metal choices **M₁/M₂** and **atomic ratio** may influence each mechanism.
- Literature retrieval (`kb_search`) can be used to **confirm/refine** any item or add new mechanisms not listed here.

## The 7 Mechanisms

### 1) Band‑Edge and Bandgap Engineering

- Core mechanism: By changing metal types, loadings, and ratios, doping can introduce impurity levels, shift conduction/valence band positions, and adjust bandgap width, thereby modifying TiO₂ band structure.
- Why it matters: Enhances visible‑light absorption and increases reducing power of photogenerated electrons, making formation of CO₂ → C₂ intermediates more feasible.

### 2) Electronic Structure & Charge Redistribution

- Core mechanism: Differences in work function, electronegativity, and electron filling between metals and TiO₂ can reshape surface electron density; bimetallic dopants can induce charge redistribution between metal sites.
- Why it matters: Tunes electron‑donating ability at active sites, affects CO₂ activation and stabilizes key intermediates (e.g., *CO, *CHO, *OCCO), impacting reaction pathways.

### 3) Charge Separation and Vectorial Transfer

- Core mechanism: Metal–TiO₂ or bimetal–TiO₂ interfaces can form Schottky junctions, heterojunctions, or multi‑step electron channels that accelerate electron–hole separation and guide directional electron transfer.
- Why it matters: Reduces recombination and increases the fraction of electrons available for CO₂ reduction, improving quantum efficiency.

### 4) Asymmetric Active‑Site Engineering

- Core mechanism: Electronegativity differences between two metals can create asymmetric sites, providing distinct adsorption/activation behaviors across adjacent sites.
- Why it matters: Promotes optimal coupling of electrons and protons at favorable geometries.

### 5) Adsorption‑Energy & Intermediate Stabilization

- Core mechanism: Metal type/loading can shift the surface d‑band center and tune adsorption energies/lifetimes of intermediates (e.g., *CO, *CHO, *COOH, *OCCO).
- Why it matters: Determines whether the CO₂ → CO → C₂ pathway is feasible, and strongly influences the probability of C–C coupling.

### 6) C–C Coupling Pathway Regulation

- Core mechanism: Bimetallic adjacent (neighboring) sites can provide cooperative adsorption geometries, biasing coupling routes such as *CO–CO and *CO–CHO.
- Why it matters: Directly affects tendency toward C₂ product formation.

### 7) Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) Suppression

- Core mechanism: Metal doping can change H* adsorption energy away from the “optimal” range for H₂ formation, suppressing HER.
- Why it matters: Improves electron utilization for CO₂ reduction and increases selectivity toward carbon products (C₁/C₂).
