# Authoritative System Prior: M₁M₂‑TiO₂ / Zr‑BTB Composite Structure

Source (Chinese): `original_assets/M₁M₂-TiO₂-Zr-BTB复合材料结构描述.docx`

This document describes the **fixed** catalyst/material system assumed by this project. It is an authoritative prior for the agent (i.e., it should not be “overridden” by speculation). Literature can add details, but the system definition below is the baseline.

## System Name and Overall Composition

**M₁M₂‑TiO₂ / Zr‑BTB** is a photocatalytic material formed by combining:

- **Dual‑metal‑doped TiO₂ nanoparticles** (top layer), and
- **Ultrathin Zr‑BTB 2D nanosheets** (bottom layer).

The system has a **bilayer structure**.

## Top Layer: TiO₂ Nanoparticle Layer (Dual‑Metal Doping)

- The top layer is a TiO₂ nano‑layer mainly composed of **TiO₂ nanoparticles with an average particle size of ~25 nm**.
- Two metals **M₁** and **M₂** are introduced into the TiO₂ layer:
  - Doped with **{fraction1}** of **{metal1}**
  - Doped with **{fraction2}** of **{metal2}**
- These metals are distributed on the TiO₂ surface at **atomic‑scale or nano‑scale**, forming **synergistic active centers**.
- The dual‑metal sites are the **key active sites** for photocatalytic **CO₂ reduction** and **C–C coupling**.
- The TiO₂ layer provides strong **light absorption** and **charge‑carrier transport**, supplying most photogenerated electrons for the reaction.

## Bottom Layer: Zr‑BTB 2D Nanosheet Layer (Microenvironment / Modifier Layer)

- The bottom layer is an ultrathin **Zr‑BTB 2D nanosheet** structure with a thickness of **~3 nm**.
- It is constructed from **Zr₆ clusters** and the organic linker **BTB** (*benzene‑1,3,5‑tribenzoate*).
  - **BTB linker is fixed** in this project (not tunable).
- The surface contains **coordinatively unsaturated Zr₆ cluster sites** that can be modified by **small molecules containing a carboxylic acid group (‑COOH)**.
  - Such modifiers are used to tune the **local catalytic microenvironment** around metal sites during the reaction.

## Interface Between the Two Layers

- The Zr‑BTB layer serves as a **physical support and dispersion platform**, enabling TiO₂ nanoparticles to attach uniformly to its surface.
- The two layers are mainly connected by **van der Waals and electrostatic interactions**, with **no obvious covalent bonding** between them.
- A stable **physical interface** forms between the two layers, maintaining structural integrity and allowing substrate/intermediate transport.

## Functional Division of Labor (High‑Level)

- The TiO₂ layer provides light absorption and **electron–hole generation**.
- The Zr‑BTB layer, via **‑COOH small‑molecule modifiers**, can interact with reactants or intermediates and thereby influence:
  - the **selectivity**, and
  - the **kinetics**
  at/around the metal active centers on TiO₂.
